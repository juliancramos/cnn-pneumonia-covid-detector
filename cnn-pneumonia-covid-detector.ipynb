        "1.  **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**\n",
        "    * Explore the dataset to identify key characteristics, including class distribution and image quality.\n",
        "    * Detect potential biases (e.g., class imbalance) and present visualizations to support design decisions.\n",
        "\n",
        "2.  **Image Preprocessing:**\n",
        "    * Implement techniques to improve input quality, such as pixel normalization and resizing.\n",
        "    * Apply **Data Augmentation** strategies to improve model generalization and prevent overfitting.\n",
        "    * Justify how these steps prepare the data for the neural network.\n",
        "\n",
        "3.  **Neural Network Design:**\n",
        "    * Design a custom **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** architecture suitable for classification.\n",
        "    * Justify the selection of layers (Convolutional, Pooling, Fully Connected), filter sizes, and activation functions.\n",
        "    * Present the architecture diagram and explain its expected behavior.\n",
        "\n",
        "4.  **Training and Evaluation:**\n",
        "    * Train the model using an appropriate optimization strategy and loss function.\n",
        "    * Evaluate performance on a validation set using robust metrics such as **Precision, Recall, and F1-Score**.\n",
        "    * Analyze results to identify issues like overfitting and propose technical solutions."
